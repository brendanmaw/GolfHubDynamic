<h1>GolfHub</h1>

<h3> Creating a full stack site to compare golf scores</h3>


<p>My first real project. Should be a website that allows me and my friends to enter our recent golf scores on our profiles and than be able to compare via the leaderboard screen. </p>

</p>Barebones website live here: http://golfhub.rf.gd/index.php</p>


<p>Please feel free to offer any advice or assistance, I am very new to programming and most of this is learning as I go.</p>
